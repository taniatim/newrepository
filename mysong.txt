There's fire in the rain
But we'll get up again
We're thousand miles apart
But we'll overcome
I'll never let you down
World is turning us around
But I feel it in my heart
Let's make a brand new start

Can't stop us now, forget the haters
Get up and live and make it matter
There's more to life so go ahead and sing it out
Can you hear a million voices
Calling out in the rain?
You know we've got a million choices
So go get out and let it rain
A million voices, voices
A million voices, voices
A million voices, voices
A million voices
